## 🎨 My Pookalam

### Description
[This project presents a Digital Pookalam (floral carpet) created using Python’s matplotlib and numpy. Traditionally, a Pookalam is made with real flowers during the Onam festival in Kerala, symbolizing harmony and prosperity.

The inspiration behind this design was to capture the essence of a real Pookalam while exploring the possibilities of art through code. The design uses mathematical symmetry, colorful geometric patterns, and layered structures to recreate the floral arrangement digitally. Each layer — from the central circle to petals, rings, and decorative stars — is carefully crafted to resemble the festive beauty of traditional Pookalams]

### Preview
